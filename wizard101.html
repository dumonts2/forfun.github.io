 <h2>What Is Wizard 101?</h2>
 <p><strong>Wizard 101</strong> is an MMORPG (Massively multiplayer online role-playing game) that was created in September 2008 by KingsIsle Entertainment. Players take on the role of student <strong>wizards</strong> which live in the fictional universe called the Spiral. All players decide at the beginning of the game what elemental <strong>school </strong>their wizard will be which determines their attacking ability, spells, and quests. The schools are: <strong>Myth, Life, Death, Storm, Fire, Ice, and Balance</strong>.
    <br><br>
 The main objective of the game is determined by <strong>Headmaster Merle Ambrose</strong>, a powerful wizard incharge of the wizarding school. Headmaster Ambrose instructs the players to save the Spiral from various villians and threats which happens as wizards level up and complete more quests. The first-arc villian is a dark wizard named <strong>Malistaire</strong> who wizards eventually fight around level 35-45. The game is heavily battle based and the main attacks are called <strong>Spells</strong> which you learn based on your school. The higher level you get, the stronger your spells! (The stronger the opponents as well.)

 <h2>My Experience Playing</h2>
 <p>I'll admit that because I was young I only got to about level 26, but I still heavily enjoyed playing nonetheless. My school was Myth which was heavily based on greek mythology. Some spells in Myth for example included: Cyclops, Trolls, Minotaurs, Centaurs, and Cerberus. All of my siblings and step-dad played Wizard 101, therefore we'd have nights where dinner would be postponed because we were stuck playing in a dungeon. Although I was a much lower level than them, I was able to join them in higher level areas because of the games teleporting to friends ability. I enjoyed the game immensely and actually decided to replay it last summer with a friend. This time I chose the school of fire and found the game a lot easier then it used to seem. Overall the game is a bit repetitive and slow, but for nostalgic reasons, it will always hold a place in my heart.</p>
