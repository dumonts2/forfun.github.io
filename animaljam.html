 <h2>What Is Animal Jam?</h2>
 <p><strong>Animal Jam</strong> is an MMORPG (Massively multiplayer online role-playing game) created in 2010 by WildWorks in collaboration with the <strong>National Geographic Society</strong>. The game ran on Adobe Flash and was found online. 
<br>
 One of the biggest differences from Animal Jam to most games was its <strong>educational</strong> aspect. National Geographic worked hard to get kids interested in environmentalism and animal conservation. Players of Animal Jam were called <strong>Jammers</strong> and could pick a variety of animals as their avatar. The first goal of the game is to fill out your <strong>Journey Book</strong> which was an interactive journal encouraging Jammers to click and find specific organisms, objects, and places around the <strong>World of Jamaa</strong>. This game was also a large forumn for kids. It was extremely common to log in and use the chat option to talk to other Jammers for hours. There were also many mini games and trades possible in Animal Jam.

 <h2>My Experience Playing</h2>
 <p>This is one of the few games that only my step-sister and I played in our household. We often saved up our money to get a $16 <strong>3 month membership </strong>that would allow us access to certain animal avatars, special items, and <strong>rares</strong>. I found myself collecting lots of <strong>beta items</strong> and clothing accessories that people often really wanted. Certain items would expire in the in game stores and would become rare, making it a high trade item. I learned my lesson through Animal Jam to not trust so easilly when I traded someone the most valuable item I had for nothing.</p>
