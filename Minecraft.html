 <h2>What Is Minecraft?</h2>
 <p><strong>Minecraft</strong> is a 3D sandbox game that was created by a Swedish game developer named Markus "Notch" Persson in May 2009. It was then taken over by Mojang Studios and is avaible under Xbox and Microsoft. The game has updated constantly since its beginning, starting with Minecraft Java Classic 1.0 to now with 1.19!

 The routes players can take in Minecraft is pretty endless. The most common path might be to start, <strong>gather materials</strong>, make shelter, get food, <strong>mine</strong>, get <strong>diamonds</strong>, get other rare ores and materials, and eventually kill the <strong>enderdragon</strong>, therefore "finishing the game". Players can choose between three settings when starting a server: <strong>Survival Mode</strong> = You can die, but you will come back to life, you are targeted by monsters, and you must find your own materials - <strong>Creative Mode</strong> = You cannot die, you have an inventory full of any item in the game, you can fly, (usaully this mode is made for building hence the Creative name) - Lastly there is <strong>Hardcore Mode</strong>, which is basically Survival Mode except once you die, you cannot reopen the server. Players generally aim to get diamonds in this game and other rare achievements. Players also have to face <strong>monsters</strong> in Minecraft most common are: <strong>Creepers, Spiders, Skeletons, and Zombies. </strong>

 <h2>My Experience Playing</h2>
 <p>Minecraft is another game in my childhood that I played with most of my family. At times we had large servers in which all of us and some of my brother's friends would join and put so much dedication to the survival server that it was practically creative by its end because of the amount of resources found. My step-sister and I often made <strong>LAN servers</strong> together in which we'd build houses side by side and try to create different furniture items out of what we had. </p>
