        <h3 style="background-color: rgb(255, 212, 212);">Background</h3>
        <p>My introduction to computer games started when I visited my stepdadâ€™s apartment for the first time. I was six years old and very curious. In my future sibling's tiny room; my older brother, step-sister, step-brother, and I piled up against the one computer chair facing a Gateway Desktop PC displaying the game, Toontown Online. Mesmerized by how much fun it was, my brother and I quickly adapted to taking turns on our own family computer at home. Here are some of the games I spent my time playing as I grew up. </p>
