 <h2>What Was Toontown?</h2>
 <p><strong>Toontown Online</strong> was an MMORPG (Massively multiplayer online role-playing game) created in June 2003 by The Walt Disney Company. The game unfortunately got shut down in 2013, but was recreated by fans and is free to play with only the name being different; Toontown Rewritten. Toontown Online's characters were called <strong>Toons</strong> which lived in Toontown. All toons in the game were animals. The choices in species included: cats, dogs, ducks, mice, pigs, rabbits, bears, horses, and monkeys.
    <br><br>
 The main objective of the game was to defeat evil-buisnessmen-like robots called <strong>Cogs</strong>. In order to battle the cogs, your toon needed <strong>Gags</strong>, which were basically the weapons of your character. The map of Toontown was seperated into seven <strong>playgrounds</strong>;areas in which toons were safe to roam without worrying about cogs. In order to get to other playgrounds, your toon had to travel through city streets which contained cogs and boss areas called <strong>cog buildings</strong>.

 <h2>My Experience Playing</h2>
 <p>My favorite parts of this game were discovered while playing with my step-sister, Victoria. Only being nine months older than me, we took focus around the same aspects of the game. Both of our toons were dogs. We spents lots of time decorating our houses together or going to the trolley to play minigames together. When it came to larger battles with cogs we'd team up with my step-dad who also played the game.</p>
